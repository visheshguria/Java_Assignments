	Q1/- Explain the meaning of the deadlock in multithreaded application, when it can occur in
		 multithreading applications.Write one example of deadlock.
		 
	Answer: The deadlock is a situation in multithreaded application where two or more threads are in the blocked
			state and are waiting for each other to. In other words whenever two threads are in blocked state or hung
			forever and are waiting for each other to execute or to reach to runnable state, but nither of them goes to 
			the runnable state. Then this is called a situation of deadlock.
			
				Usually deadlock occures when multiple threads need the same locks but obtain them in different order. 
				Or two threads are dependent on each other to execute. But they are in blocked state forever. 
				This happens due to the "Synchronized" keyword. 
												The "synchronized" keyword is used to make the class or method thread
				safe. It means that only one thread can have the lock for the synchronized method and use it, and the other 
				threads have to wait for it to get completely executed, or the release of the lock.

					public synchronized
