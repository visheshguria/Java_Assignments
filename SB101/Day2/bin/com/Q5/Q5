Q5) Explain Difference between Upper Bounded Wildcards and Lower Bounded Wildcards with Example?
1. Upper Bounded Wildcards: 
These wildcards can be used when you want to relax the restrictions on a variable. For example, say you want to write a method that works on List 
< Integer >, List < Double >, and List < Number >, you can do this using an upper bounded wildcard. 
To declare an upper-bounded wildcard, use the wildcard character (‘?’), followed by the extends keyword, followed by its upper bound. 

2. Lower Bounded Wildcards: 
It is expressed using the wildcard character (‘?’), followed by the super keyword, followed by its lower bound: <? super A>.
