Question 1: Explain difference between PriorityQueue() and LinkedList().

Answer1: The list is so created so that the highest priority element is always at the head of the list. The list is arranged in descending order 
of elements based on their priority. This allow us to remove the highest priority element in O(1) time. To insert an element we must
 traverse the list and find the proper position to insert the node so that the overall order of the priority queue is maintained.
  This makes the push() operation takes O(N) time. The pop() and peek() operations are performed in constant time.
