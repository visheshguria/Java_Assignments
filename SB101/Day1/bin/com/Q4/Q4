Question 4: Explain Generics in Java and Its Importance with example

Answer: The Java Generics programming is introduced in J2SE 5 to deal with type-safe objects. It makes the code stable by detecting the bugs at compile time.

Before generics, we can store any type of objects in the collection, i.e., non-generic. Now generics force the java programmer to store a specific type of objects.

Advantage of Java Generics
There are mainly 3 advantages of generics. They are as follows:

1) Type-safety: We can hold only a single type of objects in generics. It doesn?t allow to store other objects.
2) Type casting is not required: There is no need to typecast the object.

3) Compile-Time Checking: It is checked at compile time so problem will not occur at runtime. The good programming
 strategy says it is far better to handle the problem at compile time than runtime.
