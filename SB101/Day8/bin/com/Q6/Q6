Q6) What if we call Java run() method directly instead start() method?

Answer: 
	If run() method is called directly instead of start() method in Java code, run() method will be treated as 
	a normal overridden method of the thread class (or runnable interface). This run method will be executed with
	in the context of the current thread not in a new thread.

Points:------To Remember:
	1. When we call start() method on the thread it causes the thread to begin execution.
	2. run() method of the thread is called by the Java Virtual Machine.
	3. If we directly call run method it will be treated as a normal overridden method of the thread class 
	(or runnable interface) and it will be executed with in the context of the current thread not in a new thread.
