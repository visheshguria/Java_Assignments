Q2) What are the benefits of using Multithreading?

Answer: There are several benefits of multithreading.
		
		1. Responsiveness –
			Multithreading in an interactive application may allow a program to continue running even if 
			a part of it is blocked or is performing a lengthy operation, thereby increasing responsiveness 
			to the user.
			
		2. it is invented to avoid Idle states of the cpu.
		
		3. Make the function get executed independetly.
		
		4.Scalability –
		The benefits of multi-programming greatly increase in case of multiprocessor architecture, 
		where threads may be running parallel on multiple processors. If there is only one thread 
		then it is not possible to divide the processes into smaller tasks that different processors 
		can perform.
