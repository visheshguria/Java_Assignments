Q3) Differentiate between process and thread.

Ans--> 
    Process-->
    1.	A process is a program under execution i.e an active program.
    2. Processes require more time for context switching as they are more heavy.
    3.Processes are totally independent and donâ€™t share memory.
    4.Communication between processes requires more time than between threads.
    5.If a process gets blocked, remaining processes can continue execution.

   Thread-->
   1.A thread is a lightweight process that can be managed independently by a scheduler.
   2.Threads require less time for context switching as they are lighter than processes.
   3.A thread may share some memory with its peer threads.
   4.Communication between threads requires less time than between processes .
   5.If a user level thread gets blocked, all of its peer threads also get blocked.
