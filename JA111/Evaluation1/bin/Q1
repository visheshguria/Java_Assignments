Q1) Explain why Java is platform independent ?

Answer: The Java is known as a high level programming language which is very flexible and platform independent.
		The Java is platform independent language because it uses the JVM ( Java Virtual Machine).
		And all the compilations are done into the bytecode. That bytecode is platform independent. 
				In Simple words, JVM is different on different platforms (platform dependent) and 
		it takes care of the bytecode created on different platforms. 
		
		1. When we write a java program, the javac ( compiler) compiles it. And creates a 
			.class file which is known as bytecode. This bytecode can be used on any of the 
			platforms. 
		2. Different platforms have their JVM. JVM executes the bytecode according to the  
			platform in which it is installed. JVM is platform dependent. 	
			
			
	This is how the java is platform independent language.
