Q2) Explain about Hashcode and Equals Method.

Answer:  
	Hashcode method: java hashcode () method is a native method and returns the integer hash code value of the object.
					
					We can say that the value returned by the hashcode() method is the object's hashcode, which is the
					
					object's memory address in hexadecimal.
					
			    Contract of hashCode() method is : 
					
					1. An object hashcode value can change in multiple executions of the same application.
	
					2. if two methods are equal according to equals() method, then the hashcode must be the same.
	
	
	
	
	Equals method : The equals method go for the comparison of two object refrences. If two objects are equal then
					
					hashCode must be the same. But vice-versa is not applicable.
					
					In other words , When we want to compare two objects based on some logic, we need to override the 
					
					equals() method in that object. So, the equals() compare two entities and returns true if they are
					
					logically same.  
					
					
					1. if we want to override the equals() method, then we will also need to override() the hashCode method.
					
					2. if two methods are equal according to equals() method, then the hashcode must be the same.
