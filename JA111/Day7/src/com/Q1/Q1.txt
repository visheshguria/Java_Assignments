Q1)  Is there any difference between creating a string with and without a new operator?  
        Explain with an example.

Answer:- Example: 
String strObject = new String("Java");

and 

String strLiteral="Java";

Both expressions give you a String object, but there is a subtle difference between them. 

When you create a String object using the new() operator, it always creates a new object in heap memory.
 
On the other hand, if you create an object using String literal syntax e.g. "Java",
it may return an existing object from String pool, if it already exists. 
Otherwise, it will create a new string object and put it in a string pool for future re-use.

In other words, When we create a string using the "new" operator,
It will create the string object in the memory even if other string object exists,
But string literal (creating a string without new keyword) will check in the string pool if the string object exist or not. 

if exists then it will return the existing object otherwise it will create the object in the stringpool.
We can use it later.
