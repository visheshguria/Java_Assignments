Q What is the use of ‘this’ and ‘super’ keywords in java ? Explain with an example.

Answer :-

In java, super keyword is used to access methods of the parent class while this is used to access methods of the current class.

this keyword is a reserved keyword in java i.e, we can’t use it as an identifier. It is used to refer current class’s instance as well as static members. 

Example :- this  

class A{
	A getA(){
		// returing the instance of current class
		return this;
	}
	
	void print(){
		System.out.println("Hello This is Vishesh!");
	}
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    	new A().getA().print();
  
    }
}

Output :- Hello This is Vishesh!



Example :- super 


class Animal{  
   Animal(){
       System.out.println("animal is created");
   }  
}

class Dog extends Animal{  
     Dog(){  
	super();  
	System.out.println("dog is created");  
	}  
}  
class TestSuper3{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Dog d=new Dog();  
}}  


Output :- 
animal is created
dog is created
