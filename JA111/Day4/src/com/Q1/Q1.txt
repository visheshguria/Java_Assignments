Q1) Differentiate between static and non-static variables?

Answer: Static variables are those variables which are loaded into the context area of the 
		memory when the program is compiled. The static variables have "static" keyword 
		before the variable name. The static variables can be called directly without any 
		object because they are loaded into the memory at compile time. 
		
		
		Non-static variables are those variables which are not loaded into the memory 
		automatically. These variables are needed to be explicitly loaded into the memory 
		with the help of instances(object) of the class. Whenever the object of the class is 
		created, the non-static variables automatically loaded into the memory and wait for 
		their execution. They do not start with any keyword, but the variable name.
