Q3) Define Wrapper Classes in Java.
Answer3:
	A Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types. 
	When we create an object to a wrapper class, it contains a field and in this field,	 
	we can store primitive data types.
	In other words, we can wrap a primitive value into a wrapper class object.
	
Q4) Explain why the following block of code will give a compile time error?
	public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	float f=3.3;
	System.out.println(f);
	}
	}
	Also rectify this code.
	
Answer4: 
		This block of code will give compile error because the variable f is defined as float. 
		In java the real numbers are defined as double, but in this code the f(variable) is defined as
		float. So to rectify this code, following code is better: 
			
			public class Main {
			public static void main(String[] args) {
			float f=3.3f;
			System.out.println(f);
			}
			}
