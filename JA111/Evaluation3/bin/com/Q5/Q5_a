a) Does the below code compile successfully? If not, why?
interface A{
int i = 111;
}
class B implements A{
void methodB(){
i = 222;
}
}



Answer: No, the above code will not compile successfully because in the interface, the members and member functions have only the declaration.
		we cannot assign the values to them. They are defined in the classes which implement the interface. We cannot create the object of
		inteface also. So the above code will give the compilation error because the "i" is defined as final in the interface. Because in 
		interface, the fields ( variables) are defined as "final" and methods are defined as "abstract". 
				So, here, the variable "i" is defined as final in the interface who's value cannot be changed. So we cannot assign another value
				to the variable "i" if the interface have field "i" and it is implemented in the class. We cannot change the value of field.
				
				
				** interface have all the fields are automatically final.
